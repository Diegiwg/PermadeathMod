# Palworld Mod - Permadeath

Permadeath is a mod designed to make your game more challenging by introducing the rule that if your character dies, all items, including equipped ones, will be deleted.

## Installation

1. To install, you first need UE4SS (<https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases>).
2. Copy the **'PermadeathMod'** folder into the *Mods* folder of **UE4SS**.
3. Edit the *mods.txt* file and add the line **'PermadeathMod : 1'**.
4. Open your game and be careful not to die.

## Changelog

### v0.0.1-dev-1

In this version, when your character dies, all items, including equipped ones, will be deleted.

BUG-1: Equipped items appear as 'ghosts' on your character, but have no practical effect on stats.
